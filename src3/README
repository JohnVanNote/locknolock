I enjoyed this lab, it was fun building threaded programs and learning about
locks and whatnot. My program has been tested with various input, I kept it
all to one file so that the program would be easier to manage.

In order to run the program with no lock type:
make noLock

In order to run the program with the lock inside the for-loop type:
make lockIn

In orer to run the program with the lock outside the for-loop type:
make lockOut

The findings I've had are the noLock program will be the fastest (barely
faster than lockOut) but there is no guarantee that there will be 1,000,000
"turnstile counts". lockIn and lockOut guarantee there will be 1,000,000
counts but lockIn is painfully slower.

Each program outputs the average count and total time spent running, which
is equivalent to running the function 10x.
